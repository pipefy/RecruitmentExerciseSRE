**NOTE**: Do not make any pull request to this repository with the exercise results, we'll send an email with additional information on how to report us about it.

### Recruitment Exercise - Pipefy

The objective is to evaluate your knowledge and experience with Cloud Infrastructure and basic knowledge of the current architecture used by Pipefy.

This exercise is composed of three tasks that will be required you to know how to perform:

- Build a containerized application, anything with a sample webpage with 'Hello World!' or something like that, after that we just need that you create a Dockerfile and send the build image to Docker Hub.
- Create the Kubernetes manifests to use the image created considering three main components: Deployment file, Service, and a Configmap if needed.
- This 'Hello World!' app must print some [ENV VARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) freely created by you on the Kubernetes manifests.
- Build a simple infrastructure using Terraform 12 on AWS. You can choose between an RDS database or Elasticache.

### We also expect the following:

- We expect you to structure the results generated in a folder organizing the exercise with the code, Dockerfile, README.md, and Terraform files.
- We expect you to follow the best and most optimized configuration for the components involved.
- Even though we're asking for an RDS or an Elasticache your 'Hello World!' app does not need to use it.

### What will not be evaluated:

- The 'Hello World!' app itself. Yes, [Keep It Stupid Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- The language you choose.

### Good luck!

Feel free to ask **any questions** you might have during the development of the exercise.

Thank you!

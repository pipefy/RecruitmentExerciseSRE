## Recruitment Exercise - Pipefy

The objective is to evaluate your knowledge and experience with Cloud Infrastructure and basic knowledge of the current architecture used by Pipefy.

This exercise is composed of 3 tasks that we required you to know how to perform:

- Build a containerized application, anything with a sample webpage with Hello world or something like that, after that we just need that you create a Dockerfile and send the image generated to Dockerhub.
- Create a kubernetes receipt to use the image created considering 3 main components: Deployment file, services, and a Configmap if needed.
- Build a simple infrastructure using Terraform 12 on AWS. You can choose to build a receipt to spin up an RDS database or Elasticache.

## We also expect the following:

- We expect you to structure the results generated in a folder organizing the exercise with the code, Dockerfile, README.md, and Terraform files.
- We expect you to follow the best and most optimized configuration for the components involved.

## Good luck!

Feel free to ask **any questions** you might have during the development of the exercise.

Thank you!
